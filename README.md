# CustomStoreProject

In this project we will build a custom store allowing for a user to set up customers, create orders, add items to an order and base each item on an existing product.

#Stack

We are going to use C# for the back end basing our model on a web API structure, PostrgreSQL will be our database and for the front end we are thinking of using React JS or backbone.
